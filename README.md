# WebCam-Step-Recorder
a small app which binds camera, takes photos each some secconds, and saves in an avi file. with a log file beside.



I used AForge library, and IPBL (image processing basic library) which is my own library (i dont released its code, but you have dlls inside repository). There is a config file beside the executable file, and a log file. enjoy it.
